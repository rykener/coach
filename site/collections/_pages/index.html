      <p>Hi, I'm Eleanor. What does a coach even do? I don't know either. Let's hang out and learn how to grow together. I have a soft focus on working with queer and trans patients suffering from ME/CFS, Long Covid, and Fibromyalgia, but am open to working with all demographics of people in a variety of circumstances. </p>
