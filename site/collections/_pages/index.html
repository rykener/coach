    title: Chronic Illness Peer Coaching
    description_html: >-
      <p>Hi, I'm Eleanor. I work with people with chronic illness to help find acceptance and perspective. We collaborate together to come to a place where it is easier to relax in what is so often a viscious ableist world. I also help people through the process of seeking diagnosis and treatment. Whatever part of sick-life you're struggling to live with and integrate into we can work together to find harmony. I do not offer cures.</p><br><p>I am a transfeminine person who has lived with a variety of illnesses since birth, most recently dealing with very severe ME/CFS.</p>
