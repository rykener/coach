        <h2>Ethics</h2>
        <p align="justify">
          Because of the delicate position coaches work in, and because of a lack of oversight and regulation, it's important that we follow a well defined code of ethics. While I am not yet a member of the NBHWC, I do stick closely to their ethical guidelines, as follows.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          <h3>Definitions</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Health and Wellness Coaching</strong>: Health and Wellness Coaches partner with clients seeking self-directed, lasting changes, aligned with their values, which promote health and wellness and, thereby, enhance well- being. In the course of their work health and wellness coaches display unconditional positive regard for their clients and a belief in their capacity for change, and honoring that each client is an expert on their life, while ensuring that all interactions are respectful and non-judgmental.</li>
            <li>
              <strong>NBHWC Coach</strong>: A health and wellness coach certified by the NBHWC (after the National Certification Examination is available); and who thereby agrees to practice within the NBHWC Health and Wellness Coach Scope of Practice and Competencies and who pledges accountability to the NBHWC Code of Ethics.</li>
            <li>
              <strong>Professional Coaching Relationship</strong>: A professional coaching relationship exists when coaching includes an agreement (including contracts) that defines the rights, roles and responsibilities of each party.</li>
            <li>
              <strong>Roles within Coaching Relationships</strong>: In order to clarify roles in the coaching relationship it is often necessary to distinguish between the client and the sponsor. In most cases, the client and sponsor are the same person and are therefore jointly referred to as the client. For purposes of identification, however, the NBHWC defines these roles as follows:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Client</strong>: The “client” is the person(s) being coached.</li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Sponsor</strong>: The “sponsor” is the entity (including its representatives) paying for and/or arranging for coaching services to be provided. In all cases, coaching agreements should clearly establish the rights, roles and responsibilities for both the client and sponsor if the client and sponsor are different people.</li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Student</strong>: The “student” is someone enrolled in an NBHWC-approved coach training program or working with an NBHWC-approved faculty member or coach mentor, in order to learn the coaching process or to develop and enhance his /her coaching skills.</li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Faculty</strong>: An individual who provides primary instruction/training to students enrolled in an NBHWC-approved coach training program.</li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Mentor</strong>: An individual who conducts coaching skills performance audits and provides feedback to coaching students/coaches for the purpose of developing and enhancing health and wellness coaching skills.</li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Conflict of Interest</strong>: A situation in which a coach has a private or personal interest sufficient to appear to influence the objective of his or her professional role or responsibilities as a coach, faculty, or mentor.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Professional Conduct</h3>
          <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: none;">
              <ul>
                <li>

                      <li>Only claim ownership of my own material.</li>

                      <li>Disclose to my client and the sponsor(s) all anticipated compensation from third parties that I may receive for referrals of clients or pay to receive clients.</li>

                    </ul>

Where I reasonably believe that because one of the above circumstances is applicable, I may need to inform appropriate authorities.</li><li>Require all those who work with me in support of my clients to adhere to the NBHWC Code of Ethics, Confidentiality and Privacy Standards, and any other sections of the Code of Ethics that might be applicable.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Section 5: Continuing Development</strong> – As a coach, I:<ul><li>Commit to the need for continued and ongoing development of my professional skills.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>
