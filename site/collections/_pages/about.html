        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p align="justify">
        Hi. I'm Eleanor, but some people online know me by my other name, Lithium. I write poetry, an advice column, silly satire, and sometimes more serious essays that I am compiling for a book. I make memes, I'm disabled and queer/trans, and I contemplate a lot about how to engage in the coaching industry with integrity. I have been practicing Zen Buddhism for most of my adult life. I live in San Francisco.
        <br>
        <br>
        When I graduated high school I made the decision that college debt wasn't worth the trade off of an undergrad degree. I vowed to always learn how to operate on the allowable margins. I worked jobs as a pizza maker, a watchmaker, an electronics repair technician, chief of operations of a startup, a software engineer, and a Zen Buddhist monk. After I got <i>really</i> sick I realized how important it is to me that I spend my life helping people. I contemplated working as a chaplain or even as a minister, but unfortunately there are very few helping professions of that type that do not require a masters degree. Living in SF and putting myself through 7 years of school is financially unrealistic. This is where the coaching comes in.
        <br>
        <br>
        I believe my deep skepticism of the coaching industry and my sincere desire to engage in this work with the utmost integrity sets me up to be able help my clients...

        <h2>My health journey</h2>
        <p align="justify">
        I started experiencing chronic pain when I was 12 years old and for the most part that's been my experience ever since. About 10 years later I was in a vehicle collision that not only turned up the dial on how severe my pain was, but it also left me profoundly fatigued and with a host of other symptoms. For the next 8 years I saw doctor after doctor and I received bogus treatment after bogus treatment. I came to eventually understand for myself that I had ME/CFS but I was never able to get traction with the medical system on that.
        <br>
        <br>
        Then I got covid and my bothersome (and yet still disabling) fatigue started to get worse and worse. One week I was struggling to walk to the end of my block, and the next week I was struggling to walk to my kitchen. I went to the emergency room and they told me I was a picture of perfect health. They recommended exercise. I spent the next 10 months experiencing what is known as "very severe" ME/CFS. I mostly laid horizontally in bed and lived off Soylent and the grace of others. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Somehow, one thing led to another and I found myself in the office of a NUCCA chiropractor who was just a few minutes from my apartment. I went into his office in an electric wheelchair. He took some x-rays of my head and neck and told me my "atlas" (the C1 vertabrae) was 6 times as far out of line as it needs to be to cause significant problems. I laid on his table and he did a small massage to my upper neck. After just two treatments like this I was fully walking again. After a couple months I had built most of my strength back.
        <br>
        <br>
        This is a remarkable story, and is not normal. Not only am I lucky enough to have a version of ME/CFS that has some concrete treatment, but I was lucky enough to find that treatment and to respond to it. I do not expect most people with ME/CFS to find something similar... but we also can't know if we don't look. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Today I still live with a variety of disabling health issues, even though I have recovered from the worst of it. I am unclear if my system will ever be able to bounce back from all of the trauma of illness. I do not define my life by this.

        <h2>My training</h2>
        <p align="justify">
        I am currently training as a mental health and wellness coach as well as a hotline crisis counselor. Once my training is complete I will be eligible to sit for the National Board for Health and Wellness Coaching (NBHWC) certification. 
        <br>
        <br>
        I have completed Mental Health First Aid training and I am certified to teach the Right Use of Power program. I have been practicing Zen Buddhism, in all its facets, for over a decade. I am not a Buddhist teacher, but my extensive training in mindfulness and compassion does inform my approach. I founded and facilitate a group for transgender Buddhists.
