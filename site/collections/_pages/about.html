        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p align="justify">
        Hi. I'm Eleanor, but some people online know me by my other name, Lithium. I write poetry, an advice column, silly satire, and sometimes more serious essays that I am compiling for a book. I make memes, I'm disabled and queer/trans, and I contemplate a lot about how to engage in the coaching industry with integrity. I have been practicing Zen Buddhism for most of my adult life. I live in San Francisco.

        <br>
        When I graduated high school I made the decision that college debt wasn't worth the trade off of an undergrad degree. I vowed to always learn how to operate on the allowable margins. I worked jobs as a pizza maker, a watchmaker, an electronics repair technician, chief of operations of a startup, a software engineer, and a couple years as a Zen Buddhist monk. After I got <i>really</i> sick I realized how important it is to me that I spend my life helping people. As I recovered I contemplated working as a chaplain or even as a minister, but unfortunately there are very few helping professions of that type that do not require a masters degree. Living in SF and putting myself through 7 years of school is financially unrealistic. This is where the coaching comes in.

        I believe my deep skepticism of the coaching industry and my sincere desire to engage in this work with the utmost integrity sets me up to be able help my clients...

        <h2>My health journey</h2>
        <p align="justify">
        I started experiencing chronic pain when I was 12 years old and for the most part that's been my experience ever since. About 10 years later I was in a vehicle collision that not only turned up the dial on how severe my pain was, but it also left me profoundly fatigued and with a host of other symptoms. For the next 8 years I saw doctor after doctor and I received pointless treatment after pointless treatment. I came to eventually understand for myself that I had ME/CFS but I wasn't able to get traction with the medical system on that for another few years.
        <br>
        <br>
        Then I got covid and my bothersome (and yet still disabling) fatigue started to get worse and worse. One week I was struggling to walk to the end of my block, and the next week I was struggling to walk to my kitchen. I went to the emergency room and they told me I was a picture of perfect health. They recommended exercise. I spent the next 10 months experiencing what is known as "very severe" ME/CFS. I mostly laid horizontally in bed and lived off Soylent and the grace of others. I needed an electric wheelchair just to navigate my small Bay Area apartment. I rarely saw the sun. 
        <br>
        <br>
        I was lucky enough to encounter a series of medical professionals who identified that I have Craniocervical Instability (CCI), essentially learning that my neck is hypermobile. It appeared that for the last decade my spinal cord was being crushed, and that this was the cause of my ME/CFS. I now work with a specialized chiropractor to help keep my upper cervical spine in alignment and I no longer experience the worst parts of ME/CFS.
        <br>
        <br>
        Today I still live with a variety of disabling health issues, even though I have recovered from the worst of it. I am unclear if my system will ever be able to bounce back from all of the trauma of illness. I do not define my life by this.

        <h2>My training</h2>
        <p align="justify">
        I am currently training as a mental health and wellness coach as well as a hotline crisis counselor. Once my training is complete I will be eligible to sit for the National Board for Health and Wellness Coaching (NBHWC) certification. 
        <br>
        <br>
        I have completed Mental Health First Aid training and I am certified to teach the Right Use of Power program. I have been practicing Zen Buddhism, in all its facets, for over a decade. I am not a Buddhist teacher, but my extensive training in mindfulness and compassion does inform my approach. I founded and facilitate a group for transgender Buddhists.
