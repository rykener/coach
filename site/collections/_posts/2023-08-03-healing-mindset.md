*Dear Eleanor,*

*First I'd like to thank you for sharing your more philosophical thoughts and diary entries. Reading them got me thinking and has been an inspiration to start the long process of getting better. I've realized that I need some pretty intensive mental health help and I'm checking into a residential therapy program next week. I was wondering if you have any experience with that or any advice for staying in a mindset of healing and how I can be prepared for my stay?*

Dear Getting Better,

I don’t know you, but I can still be proud of you. It takes a lot of internal strength to go up against what you’re describing. The first step is usually the hardest, so congrats on that.
