## What this is

You and me in a series of video calls talking about you and your health. We can cover any number of topics depending on your needs. I see the topics that I work with clients on in two primary baskets: 

* First we have things that are very **practical in nature**. Seeking diagnosis, understanding an illness, navigating the system, problem solving, skill building, symptom tracking, motivation, boundaries, pacing, dealing with family/friends/medical professionals. This list has no end, but at a high level, it's about the practicalities of being sick. Being sick **is a skill** and as with most skills, it requires practice and it helps to have a mentor.
* The other basket is more ephemeral. It's about **finding well-being inside of an envelope of illness**. I'm not here to cure you, that's your doctors' jobs. But I am telling you, you can live your life with more grace, love, and beauty than any able-bodied person you know. In this realm we work with acceptance, emotional healing, grief, power, fear, love, loss, spirituality. At certain points in our lives it's more helpful to focus on these types of things as opposed to practical solutions to problems. In a broken medical system, practical solutions sometimes only get us so far.

I offer to train all my clients in various mindfulness techniques, including meditation. These practices are not for everyone, but for those who are interested they often find them beneficial. 

**Is this therapy?** No, this isn't therapy, this is a coaching program. They can seem similar, but the primary differences are that we focus on specifically on chronic illness and skills surrounding it as well as the fact that I have undergone a different set of training than therapists. We can talk about problems in your life as they relate to chronic illness, but I'm not here to help you process the trauma from a breakup or when your parents divorced, for example.


## What this isn't

I do not provide medical advice, diagnoses, cures, treatments, or therapy. I have a long history of dealing with my own severe illnesses and I am trained to work as a "mental health coach," which can look similar to therapy but does not involve the same training.

Many "coaching" businesses are built from a model that I find largely unethical. Coaches often are selling you on themselves and their lifestyle and the resulting promise is that if you hire them you can also begin to live the way they do. There's big talk about "trauma resolution," "sex empowerment," and "womb healing." I don't think these are bad things but I do think that generic "therapy speak" is getting weaponized against consumers. I believe you can tell what a coach is selling by looking at their photographs and their social media presence. I am not selling some vision of spirituality. My spirituality and my vision are rooted firmly in the practical. I am also not selling a lifestyle. I do not provide information about my lifestyle and I do not try to paint a picture of it as I do not see that type of information as important to how we work together. 

I don't want my clients to strive to live the way that I do. I am not a living example. I am a person who has walked a very specific path and learned some specific things. You aren't here to walk my path. I am here to help you walk (or roll on) your own. 

## Model & Pricing

| **Offering** | **Time**   | **Price** |
|==============|============|===========|
| Intro Call   | 10 minutes | Free      |
| Session      | 50 minutes | $50-$250 |

I maintain availability in a variety of tiers. The below table explains what rates I am currently accepting clients at. I ask that folks be honest with themselves about what they can comfortably pay in order to leave room for other folks who may have lower incomes. People who elect to pay at more expensive tiers directly fund my ability to offer services at less expensive tiers. For example, a client paying $250 per session allows me to fund a new $50 slot.

 | **Fee Per Session** | **Slots Available?** |
 |=====================|======================|
 | $250                | Available            |
 | $200                | Available            |
 | $150                | Available            |
 | $100                | Not available        |
 | $50                 | Not available        |

**Intro call?** A quick phone call where we can check in about wants, needs, and goals. This is a very brief way to help us determine if we want to work together. There is no charge for this. This is not a sales call.

**Where are the package deals? The bonus content? The discounts?** I do not offer package deals, bonus content, or discounts. These are marketing tactics and are not appropriate for my practice. I want you to have as many sessions with me as you'd like, without me locking you into some predefined number that says "this is how long it's going to take". You can meet with me as much or as little as you want. That being said, please expect to need to meet more than a couple times in order for us to make progress together. Depending on what we're working on I like to see clients at least 10 times, however, this is not a rule. It's all up to you.
