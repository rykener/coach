## Who is this for?

Consulting services are for people who are not chronically ill, but typically do have a sick person in their life that they care about. This could be a spouse, a child, a parent, a lover, an employee, a friend, or anyone else. 

## What do we learn?

As with all my services, I do not offer a bullet point list as to what you are going to learn. Instead we will talk about what is happening for you, what are your roadblocks, what are your grievances, areas you want to grow in, and anything else that feels relevant. When I'm in my 1-on-1 coaching calls, I tend to not give out advice unless it's asked for. In my consulting calls, however, the whole premise is that you are coming to me for advice. 

Expect for me to tell you that I think you're wrong about something. I want to help you be the best version of yourself that you can be for the sick person in your life. To do that I will not lie to you and I will be straightforward about what I think you should do. 

## What makes you good at this?

I have lived as an exceptionally sick person for most of my life. I have received care from people who were endlessly compassionate and I have had to navigate relationships that were deeply toxic while being bedridden. I have walked many paths in my illness journey alongside a variety of people, and I have learned so much. 

Aside from my real world experience, I'm just really good at analyzing situations and talking to people about interpersonal dynamic. I don't use big words, I don't rely on far out academic theories, but instead I just show up with an open heart and I use all my communication skills to be the best person I know how to be. It's actually really simple work. I'm not here because I'm a doctor, I'm here cause I know how to fight doctors. I'm here because I know what it means to be cared for and I know what it means to care.
