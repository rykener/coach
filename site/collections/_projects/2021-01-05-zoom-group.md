## What's this group about?

The **Sick Shit** group is for queer and trans people who are looking for camaraderie, community, or connection around matters of health. It's also a great way to meet me if you're considering a coaching session. The group meets once a month on Zoom for 90 minutes and typically follows the same format each meeting:

* Introductions
* Guided meditation
* Short break
* A talk about a topic relating to being sick
* Group discussion of the topic
* Room for discussion about other topics

Depending on how many people attend we may use breakout groups at various points in the program. 

The whole thing is pretty straight forward: we come together and we build a space. We have to actively envision the space we want to be in and then we have to work together to build that space. This requires participation and care on behalf of the attendees. 

## Sounds like this could get pretty heavy?

Yeah. I mean, dealing with chronic illness is a heavy thing. This is a space where people can address the difficult parts of being sick.
