## What this is

This is a space for you and me to work together on what is typically a predefined problem of yours, or maybe your problem is that you're not quite sure what your problem is. That's okay too, we can work to define it together. I create a non-judgemental, supportive space where you will be completely heard, and where you will have access to my feedback and advice if you want it. 

We will work together to create systems of resilience in your life. This can look like building acceptance, navigating social supports, or practicing joy. Or resilience can look like anything we want it to. When we start building up our day-to-day resilience we fortify ourselves and switch to a more proactive form of mental health care. 

I draw heavily from my 10+ years of training in Zen Buddhism to offer a wide range of mindfulness practices and techniques. Mindfulness is not for everyone, and it is not for every situation, but when carefully applied to the right moment it can have a profound impact on our lives.  

We can set goals, build outcomes, and navigate personal growth. One of my jobs is to help you discover, clarify, and align with these goals. I'll help you discover for yourself what the solutions and strategies are for moving forward. One of my goals is that you can learn how I work so that you can move forward without me. I will stick with you as you integrate into this new way of living, helping with accountability as you feel it's necessary. 

## What this isn't

Coaching is not therapy, and I am not a therapist. I do not diagnose or treat mental illness (though I do work with people who have mental illness). Further, while some coaches offer "trauma processing," it is my belief that this work should be done with a licensed therapist. While sometimes past traumas may come up in our work, it cannot be our explicit focus. Some clients find that focusing on new attitudes for the present may help them recontextualize the past. We will use the past to help us understand the present, but the past cannot be our focus beyond contextualizing the now. Processing the past is work that should be done with a therapist. 

I do not emphasize "positive thinking" as a solution to life's problems. While this approach has its time and place, it is known to [sometimes make things worse](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272735812000177).


## Model & Pricing

| **Offering** | **Time**   | **Price** |
|==============|============|===========|
| Intro Call   | 10 minutes | Free      |
| Session      | 50 minutes | $50-$250 |

I maintain availability in a variety of tiers. The below table explains what rates I am currently accepting clients at. I ask that folks be honest with themselves about what they can comfortably pay in order to leave room for other folks who may have lower incomes. People who elect to pay at more expensive tiers directly fund my ability to offer services at less expensive tiers. For example, a client paying $250 per session allows me to fund a new $50 slot.

 | **Fee Per Session** | **Slots Available?** |
 |=====================|======================|
 | $250                | Available            |
 | $200                | Available            |
 | $150                | Available            |
 | $100                | Not available        |
 | $50                 | Not available        |

**Intro call?** A quick phone call where we can check in about wants, needs, and goals. This is a very brief way to help us determine if we want to work together. There is no charge for this. This is not a sales call.

**Where are the package deals? The bonus content? The discounts?** I do not offer package deals, bonus content, or discounts. These are marketing tactics and are not appropriate for my practice. I want you to have as many sessions with me as you'd like, without me locking you into some predefined number that says "this is how long it's going to take". You can meet with me as much or as little as you want. That being said, please expect to need to meet more than a couple times in order for us to make progress together. Depending on what we're working on I like to see clients at least 10 times, however, this is not a rule. It's all up to you.
