    <div class="post-content" style="text-align: justify;">
      <p><em>Feeling burned out from my last job and uncertain about my next steps, I decided to pursue a lifelong aspiration of mine: a Yoga Teacher Training. The training was nothing short of transformative: a profound journey of healing and growth unfolded. Since completing the training, my exploration of life’s vast possibilities has been ceaseless, continually pushing boundaries and embracing new ways of living with an open heart and an eager spirit.</em></p>

<h2 id="yoga-and-i">Yoga and I</h2>

<p>My yogi journey began from being frustrated with experiencing intolerable pain in my body after intense physical exercise. Not only did I want to understand the cause of my discomfort, but I also wanted to explore gentler and more-attuned-to-my-body forms of exercising.</p>

<p>Coincidentally, a friend who had been embracing the path of becoming a yoga instructor was inviting people to join her classes. I had been very much inspired by her journey, so I decided to go to my first class: a yin yoga session.</p>

<p>Amidst a summer internship where stress was a constant companion, my first session offered me an unexpected reset; I awoke the next day completely disoriented, unsure of where I was or what day of the week it was. I felt deeply rested and completely rejuvenated.</p>

<p>The impact of yoga was so profound that I was determined to continue practicing. But it wasn’t until the pandemic lockdown that it became an essential part of my life. Thanks to the Down Dog app, I started practicing yoga from home and tailoring sessions to my preferences. I could pick any body area to focus on and even pre-set the duration of each class. Yoga integrated smoothly into my daily routine.</p>

<p>A few months into my yoga practice, its effects on my body became apparent. I ceased snoring, grew more reluctant to drink alcohol and more aware of the impact of different foods on my body. Over time, yoga enhanced many other aspects of my life such as my physical balance, mental focus, tolerance for pain, allergies, my ability to process emotions and adaptability to new environments. But most importantly, it broadened my mindset allowing me to experience and benefit from other disciplines as well.</p>

<h2 id="stepping-into-a-yoga-teacher-training">Stepping into a Yoga Teacher Training</h2>

<p>Transitioning from university life and an entrepreneurial venture, I found myself navigating through various roles within the corporate world. After my last job, however, I felt disconnected and burned out. Amidst a period of uncertainty, pursuing a Yoga Teacher Training emerged as a hopeful beacon of clarity.</p>

<p>My heart was set on Lake Atitlán in Guatemala — a place whose magical community had previously captivated me and promised the depth of immersion I yearned for. I considered various venues, eventually settling for the Mystical Yoga Farm as the place for my training. I had never been there, but I was ready to step beyond the familiar confines of my comfort zone.</p>

<p>The farm turned out to offer a variety of activities that nurtured the mind, body and spirit. With yoga sessions, vibrant ecstatic dances, traditional temazcales and peaceful morning lake swims, this place was ideal to recover from life’s heavy upheavals. Beyond my yoga practice, I acquired numerous well-being techniques and practices that I still use today.</p>

<p>The community was also special and played a crucial role in my recovery. Together with everyone at the farm, we cultivated a sanctuary of safety and freedom. The place became a space where every single one of us could freely express themselves and experience warm unconditional love and acceptance from the community. Through each practice, ceremony, and shared moment, my spirit was slowly infused with a profound sense of belonging and love.</p>

<h2 id="studying-the-theory">Studying the theory</h2>

<p>Amidst the rich social encounters, my exploration into the origins and philosophy of yoga opened new horizons of understanding for me. I learned that yoga was meant to guide you towards enlightenment and help you navigate life’s inevitable sufferings with grace.</p>

<p>Diving into the Yoga Sutras of Patañjali, one of the foundational texts of classical Yoga philosophy, I was introduced to the 8 limbs of yoga. This comprehensive framework provided me with invaluable insights and acted as a blueprint for a life of balance and harmony. The Yamas (ethical restraints) and the Niyamas (observances), for instance, resonated deeply with me. The Yamas taught me the significance of ethical conduct in interactions with the world, learning the importance of practicing non-violence, truthfulness, integrity, moderation, and non-attachment. Conversely, the Niyamas directed my focus inward, highlighting the importance of cleanliness, contentment, discipline, self-study, and surrender to a higher power, as pillars for personal growth and enlightenment.</p>

<p>Our discussions also ventured into the realm of Karma, a concept that had captivated me upon reading Sadhguru’s book. These discussions shed light on the profound truth that each of our actions, thoughts and intentions set forth ripples in the Universe. Karma isn’t just about cause and effect though; it’s about performing actions with purity and without selfish desires, thereby cleansing our hearts and fostering spiritual growth. Understanding Karma as a form of selfless service instilled in me a commitment to live for the benefit of others, viewing such service not only as an act of devotion but as a pathway to authentic spirituality. This has become the cornerstone of my life’s purpose, guiding me to dedicate my life to serving others with an open heart.</p>

<h2 id="stepping-out-of-the-community">Stepping out of the community</h2>

<p>Stepping out of this idyllic setting and back into the wider world, riddled with injustice and disconnection, was perhaps the hardest part. Suddenly, I found myself reminded of the pervasive materialism and disconnection that define much of modern society.</p>

<p>I entered waves of depression due to a constant inner struggle that couldn’t accept me falling back into old habits and becoming my former self again. It felt as though I had evolved so much in just a few weeks, yet the world around me hadn’t changed a single bit.</p>

<p>The expectation and pressure from my environment and relationships to behave exactly as I used to were suffocating. It took me months to integrate everything I had learned and to fully accept myself and my past again.</p>

<p>The life I was leading, chasing after success and comfort as defined by society, was taking me further from my true self. Material possessions, job titles, and productivity no longer made sense to me. I realized I had been living a life filled with possessions but devoid of happiness, a life of conformity with little room for growth and authenticity. To find peace and purpose, I had to break away from these chains and wander away from the familiar to discover truths that society overlooks or deliberately ignores.</p>

<p>Thankfully, this journey away from the conventional path led me to a community of like-minded souls, individuals who also sought meaning beyond the material, who valued the richness of experience over the accumulation of things. In this community, I found a deeper connection to the essence of life, a shared understanding that there is more to existence than what mainstream culture acknowledges.</p>

<p>As I navigate a world overly characterized by its history, conservative values and an increasingly over-reliance on technology, the lessons learned through yoga and the principles of a more sustainable, human-centric approach to living have never been more relevant. Now, more than ever, it is imperative that we advocate for a society that values the human spirit and the planet over the relentless pursuit of technological advancement and economic growth.</p>

<p>In closing, my journey through yoga has been much more than a path to personal growth; it has been a call to challenge the status quo, to seek a life that is rich in connection, authenticity, and purpose. It is a reminder that happiness and fulfilment lie not in what we own or achieve, but in how deeply we connect with ourselves, with others and ultimately, with our Universe. As I look forward, I hope to carry this wisdom with me and to spread it around me, forging a path that leads not only to individual well-being but to the healing of the world.</p>
